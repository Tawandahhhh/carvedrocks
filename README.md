How I carried out the assignment

Step 1
Wrote the program with Visual Studio Code.The program was coded with C#
My web app contains 2 types of files, a css main file and a html file.
Ran the program on Visual Studio code to make sure it works without any . 

Step 2
For version and source control I used Github and I uploaded my code to my Git repo.

Code contains a README file explaining the assignment

Step 3
I took the web app to the cloud 
To to orchestarate and deploy the app I made use of Microsoft Azure.
Azure provides a service for creating static web apps so I made use of their service.
